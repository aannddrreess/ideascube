The data file in this directory has been originally created with the
`dumpdata` command.

The database which was dumped had been generated randomly, with the goal of
having a comprehensive data set to test data migrations, covering as many
interesting corner cases as possible.

With time, we manually edit it to cover more corner cases, and improve the data
migration testing. It must also be edited before making a new release which
includes some data migrations.

Due to the data having been originally randomly generated, it might
unfortunately contain profanity or other undesirable language. Do let us know
if you find any, and we will manually edit it.
